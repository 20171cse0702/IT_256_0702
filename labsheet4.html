<p style="background-color:lightblue;color=blue;font-size=200%" id="p1">The main carry over component from the Veyron is the 7,993 cc (8.0 L) quad-turbocharged W16 engine, though it is heavily updated. The engine in the Chiron has a peak power output of 1,103 kW (1,500 PS; 1,479 hp) at 6,700 rpm and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) of torque starting from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm. The engine in the most powerful variant of its predecessor, the Veyron Super Sport generates 220 kW (299 PS; 295 bhp) less than the new Chiron, while the engine in the original Veyron generates 367 kW (499 PS; 492 hp) less power</p>

<p style="background-color:red;color=black;font-size:200%"" id="p2">The Chiron can accelerate from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in 2.4 seconds according to the manufacturer,[4] 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 6.5 seconds and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.6 seconds. In a world-record-setting test at the time in 2017, the Chiron reached 400 km/h (249 mph) in 32.6 seconds, after which it needed 9.4 seconds to brake to standstill.</p>

<p style="background-color:green;color=blue;font-size:200%" id="p3">The Chiron's top speed is electronically limited to 420 km/h (261 mph), or 375–380 km/h (233–236 mph) without the specific key, for safety reasons, mainly arising from the tyres as the manufacturer concluded that no tyre currently manufactured would be able to handle the stress at the top speed the Chiron is capable of achieving.[2][17] Independent testing by an owner has indicated that the Chiron can easily attain its limited top speed.[18] Mixed fuel consumption is 22.5 L/100 km (12.55 mpg‑imp; 10.45 mpg‑US).</p>


<p style="background-color:yellow;color=black;font-size:200%" id="p4">At the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, Bugatti unveiled the track focused iteration of the Chiron dubbed the Chiron Sport. Mechanically, the car is identical to its regular counterpart generating 1,500 PS (1,103 kW; 1,479 hp) from a quad-turbocharged W16 engine but is 18 kg (40 lb) lighter due to the extensive use of carbon fibre and utilises a stiffer suspension in order to increase the cornering ability of the car while maintaining its grand touring characteristics. The steering wheel of the car has also received modifications along with the introduction of a torque vectoring system to control the power sent to each wheel of the car for improved handling in tight corners. Aerodynamic improvements and light weight have been given special consideration in order to keep the car competitive on the race track. The Chiron Sport became available in late 2018 for an additional US$400,000 on the standard Chiron
At the 2017 IAA show in Frankfurt, Bugatti announced that the Chiron broke the record of fastest 0–400–0 km/h (0–249–0 mph) acceleration time, completing it in 41.96 seconds in a span of 3.2 kilometres (2 miles) at the Ehra-Lessien high-speed oval. The car was driven by Colombian racing driver Juan Pablo Montoya.[35][36][37]

Bugatti also added an extra livery to the Chiron on display to confirm that it was the same car that broke the 0–400–0 km/h record.[38] During the show, Bugatti also mentioned that during the run, the car accelerated from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.4 seconds, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 6.1 seconds, 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.1 seconds, and 0–400 km/h (0–248.5 mph) in 32.6 seconds, which altogether, also makes the Chiron faster than its predecessor, the Veyron.[38]
